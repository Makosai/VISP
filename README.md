## Video
**Core functionality:** Clip trimming, arranging, transitions, speed adjustments, and more.

**Description:** The video section is made to be fluid and versitile for core video editing tasks. We want to focus on making things simple to achieve professional-looking cuts and effects. All while keeping the ability to dive deeper into more advanced features when needed.

**Features:** The video section will have a timeline, preview window, and a library of effects and transitions. The timeline will be able to handle multiple video and audio tracks. The preview window will be able to show the video in real-time with effects applied. The library will have a collection of effects and transitions that can be applied to the video.

**Potential Features:** The video section could have a built-in screen recorder, a built-in webcam recorder, and a built-in audio recorder. The video section could also have a built-in video converter, a built-in video compressor, and a built-in video downloader.

**Potential AI Features:** The video section could have AI features that can automatically detect and remove background noise, objects, people, and even music.

## Images
**Core functionality:** Image editing, filters, effects, color correction, basic manipulation (cropping, resizing), and more.

**Description:** The image section is made to be simple and easy to use for basic image editing tasks. And to also allow you to use images from the video projects you've made and even include images in your video projects too.

**Features:** Advanced color grading tools.

**Potential Features:** AI-powered colored-correction, background removal, image enhancement, and more.

## Sound
**Core functionality:** Audio editing, mixing, effects, volume control, basic effects (fade in/out & equalization), and more.

**Description:** VISP simplifies the process of syncing audio with visuals. You'll get tools for cleaning up audio recordings and enhancing soundtracks when used with the Video editor. And you can even make music with the Sound section too.

**Potential AI Features:** We're going to explore the possibilities of automatic voiceover generation, AI-powered music composition tailored to the video's mood, or smart noise reduction technology.

## Post

**Core functionality:** Social media integration, sharing, and publishing.

**Description:** The Post section is where you can share your creations with the world. You can publish your videos, images, and soundtracks to your favorite social media sites like YouTube and Instagram. And you can even schedule posts to be published at a later time.

**Potential Features:** The Post section could have a built-in social media manager, a built-in analytics tool, and a built-in scheduler.
